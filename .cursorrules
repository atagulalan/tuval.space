# tuval.space Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
- Collaborative pixel art platform built with React, TypeScript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS
- Users receive daily pixel quotas to place pixels on shared boards
- Real-time updates and change history tracking

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no inline styles)
- Prefer named exports over default exports (except for pages)
- Use absolute imports with @ alias for src/

## File Organization
- Components: `/src/components/`
- UI Components: `/src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui)
- Pages: `/src/pages/`
- Services: `/src/services/`
- Hooks: `/src/hooks/`
- Types: `/src/types/`
- Utils: `/src/lib/`

## Firebase
- Use modular Firebase SDK imports
- All Firebase operations should have try-catch blocks
- Use real-time listeners for live data
- Respect Firestore security rules

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state (auth)
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use custom hooks for reusable state logic

## Testing
- Write unit tests for services and utilities
- Use Jest for testing
- Mock Firebase in tests

## Git Workflow
- Follow conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- All commits must pass linting and tests via husky hooks
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Performance
- Lazy load pages where possible
- Optimize canvas rendering with requestAnimationFrame
- Use Firestore queries efficiently to minimize reads
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML
- Include ARIA labels where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain color contrast ratios

## Do NOT
- Edit translation files manually (tr.json, en.json)
- Commit sensitive data or API keys
- Use any/unknown types without good reason
- Skip error handling
- Create components without TypeScript types
